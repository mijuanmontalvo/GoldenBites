# GoldenBites
Project on a web application to make food reservations in a kitchen of a residence of older adults

# Introduction

Senior residences normally include breakfast, lunch and dinner in their accommodation service, additionally, they also offer differentiated food service for breakfast, lunch and dinner, that is, food dishes that are not established in the common daily menu, so it is necessary for the kitchens of the residences to prepare additional food based on the orders of their guests.

## Problem Statement

The problem here is that the kitchens of the residences do not know the additional quantity of different dishes that they must prepare and this can generate disorganization in the kitchen, bad service and food waste.


## Solution

To solve this problem, an app will be created (GoldenBites) so that the guests of the residences can reserve additional dishes in the kitchen. This information will be saved in a database and through this same application the kitchen will be able to verify the additional dishes that it will have to prepare for a certain date.
